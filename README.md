Eirene Bringing Peace to Enyo
=============================

The HP Enyo framework for webOS is one of the best mobile HTML5 based frameworks out there to work with.  With HP's recent decision to exit the mobile hardware market and no clear visible future in sight, developers of the platform are left in quite a quandry.  So what's a developer to do? Go cross-platform of course!  PhoneGap is usually the standard fare to go about such an endeavor but it lacks a user interface component as it focuses on abstracting the hardware and Operating System components. What you don't want to learn yet another mobile UI framework?  Well since Enyo is HTLM5 based it is a perfect compliment to PhoneGap and you already know it (if you don't it is very easy to learn).  Unfortunately at this time though, it is against the Enyo user license to distribute it on other platforms.  We have high hopes that this will change though since it such a great fit for PhoneGap and when it does some of the controls that have webOS specific API dependancies will need to be recreated to use the PhoneGap APIs.  So this brings us to Eirene, a collection of Enyo controls that work with the PhoneGap API's.

## Eirene the Goddess of Peace

Since Enyo is the goddess of war, we decided that our control collection should be named after the goddess of peace since cross-platform controls are designed to bring peace to the battles developers face when choosing what platforms to develop for.
